# WatchCutterWeb
A small tool that converts text into images for mobile devices. 

Initially planned as tool to create cheatsheets for an iPod Nano, support for epub is planned though. 

## Requirements
While the project initially started was started on NodeJS, I quickly came to the conclusion that I want it as a static website.
I will include a "Releases" folder that will contain the portable web version as well as a link to a place to github pages.
